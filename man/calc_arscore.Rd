\title{Calculate Aggregate Reactivity Scores}
\usage{
calc_arscore(
  norm_log,
  all_peptide_fcs,
  positives,
  exclusion_method = "genus",
  seed = 120
)
}
\arguments{
\item{norm_log}{Data frame containing intermediate reactivity metrics.}

\item{all_peptide_fcs}{Data frame containing all peptide fold changes for an individual sample.}

\item{positives}{Data frame containing taxa determined to be significant (excluded from null).}

\item{exclusion_method}{Character string; method for excluding likely reactive peptides.
Options: "genus", "species", "group".}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility of random sampling.}
}
\value{
A data frame with added columns for shape, rate, mean, variance, ARscore, and p_val.
}
\description{
Generates aggregate reactivity scores by comparing the average fold change
of a group of peptides to null distributions derived from random sampling.
